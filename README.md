# Carbon Footprint Calculator (Java)

## Overview

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a Java console application designed to help users estimate their environmental impact based on everyday lifestyle choices. The program asks a series of questions related to transport, home energy usage, diet, recycling habits, and shopping behaviour, and then calculates a score that represents the user’s overall carbon footprint.

This project was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** and demonstrates the application of software engineering principles outside of formal coursework, treating the program as a small real-world product rather than a purely academic exercise.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to:

* Raise awareness of sustainability and environmental responsibility
* Demonstrate real-world problem solving using Java
* Apply professional programming practices such as input validation and user-friendly interaction

The project aligns with sustainability themes and shows how software can be used to influence positive behavioural change.

## Features

* Console-based user interaction
* Multiple-choice questions covering key sustainability areas:

  * Transport
  * Home energy usage
  * Diet
  * Recycling habits
  * Shopping frequency
* Carbon footprint scoring system
* Input validation to handle unexpected user input safely
* Clear and readable output for users

---

## Technologies Used

* **Java**
* **IntelliJ IDEA**
* Java `Scanner` class for user input

---

## How to Run the Program (IntelliJ IDEA)

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Create a new **Java Project**
3. Create a new Java class named:

   ```
   CarbonFootprintApp
   ```
4. Copy the program code into the class
5. Click **Run** or press `Shift + F10`
6. Follow the on-screen prompts in the console

## Input Validation

To improve reliability and robustness, user input is:

* Trimmed of unnecessary spaces
* Converted to uppercase for consistency
* Checked using `switch` statements
* Safely handled with default cases to prevent program crashes

This reflects real-world software development where user input cannot be assumed to be correct.

## Learning Outcomes

Through developing this project, I:

* Applied Java programming skills outside of structured coursework
* Improved my understanding of user interaction and input handling
* Considered sustainability as a real-world computing issue
* Gained experience writing maintainable and readable code
* Practised treating software as a product with real users in mind
